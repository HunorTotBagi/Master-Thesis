This thesis reviewed fundamental principles of Machine learning, including the
Inexact Restoration method and Hinge loss Binary Classification method. The
IRNS algorithm was implemented and tested on real data problems, showing
advantages in terms of computational cost. The method was also tested on an IoT
dataset, showing benefits of adaptive sample size and second order information.
